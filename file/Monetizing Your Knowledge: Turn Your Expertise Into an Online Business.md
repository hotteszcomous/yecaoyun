## Identifying Your Expertise

To determine how to monetize your knowledge, follow these steps:

1. **Evaluate Your Skills and Interests**:
   - Create a quadrant:
     - Things you're good at and enjoy.
     - Things you're good at but donâ€™t enjoy.
     - Things youâ€™re not good at but enjoy.
     - Things youâ€™re not good at and donâ€™t enjoy.
   - Focus on the top-left quadrant (skills you enjoy and excel at).

2. **Set Goals**:
   - Establish measurable, actionable goals. For example, "I want to make $50,000 in the first year of my online business."

3. **Develop a Strategy**:
   - Decide on a niche and identify your target audience.

## Creating Your Sales Funnel

A sales funnel is a crucial component of online businesses. It guides your audience from awareness to becoming paying customers. Here are six steps to build an effective sales funnel:

### Step 1 & 2: Create Content and Edit Videos
- **Leverage YouTube**: Start with free content on YouTubeâ€”itâ€™s free to use and great for reaching a global audience.
- **Editing**: Learn to edit engaging videos to make your content binge-worthy and attract more viewers.

- Worksheets
- Cheat sheets
- Guides
- Checklists

Connect your opt-in incentive to an email marketing platform like ConvertKit.

### Step 4: Create a Landing Page
Youâ€™ll need two types of landing pages:
1. A page to house your email opt-in form.
2. A tripwire pageâ€”offering a limited-time, low-cost product to convert subscribers into customers quickly.

Platforms like Leadpages are ideal for creating high-converting landing pages with automation features like countdown timers. ðŸ‘‰ [Try Leadpages for free!](https://bit.ly/LEadPages)
