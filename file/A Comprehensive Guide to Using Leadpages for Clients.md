## Features of Leadpages

While Leadpages is primarily recognized as a landing page builder, its extensive list of features makes it a powerful tool capable of taking your online business to the next level. Here's what sets it apart:

### Ready-to-Use Templates

Leadpages offers an extensive library of high-converting, mobile-friendly templates that ensure your landing page looks stunning on any device. These drag-and-drop templates allow for quick customization to align perfectly with your brand and campaign goals. With Leadpages, you can create professional, high-converting landing pages with no coding requiredâ€”even if you donâ€™t have a website.

### LeadBoxes for Better Conversions

LeadBoxes are customizable pop-ups that can be strategically placed across your website or blog to capture leads. Features include:

- **Timer-Based Popups**: Show pop-ups after a set time to engage visitors.
- **Exit Intent Popups**: Display offers or content when a user is about to leave the site.
- **Click-Triggered Popups**: Launch pop-ups when users click on a button, text, or image.

These features ensure you capture more leads and reduce wasted traffic.

Leadpages even adds a Facebook Pixel to your pages automatically for better retargeting and analytics.
