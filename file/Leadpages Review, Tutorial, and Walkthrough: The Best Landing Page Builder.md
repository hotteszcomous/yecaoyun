## Leadpages Pricing

Leadpages offers three pricing plans to cater to different needs:

1. **Standard Plan:** Ideal for small businesses and basic users.
2. **Pro Plan:** Perfect for those who need advanced features like unlimited A/B testing, sales integrations, and payment processing.
3. **Advanced Plan:** Suited for large teams with additional features and support.

If youâ€™re planning to sell products or services directly from your pages, I recommend the **Pro Plan**. It supports recurring payments and delivers digital products seamlessly. You can also set up unlimited A/B testing to optimize your campaigns.

However, even the Standard Plan is powerful enough for creating sales pages and connecting to external payment platforms. For example, you can use Leadpages for your landing page and integrate it with a checkout page from another platform.
